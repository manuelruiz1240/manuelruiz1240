I have been self-taught since 2009, learning and implementing new trends in information technology. I started designing Blogger templates for Blogger, later I started creating "CMS" scripts such as Blogs, e-Commerce, Online Communities, ERP / CRM / HRM Integral Systems, etc.


Currently working at Microsoft. I'm a developer and **creator of Vida MRR**, a personal project dedicated to help other developers to increase their technical skills in web design, web development, problems solving, and more. My main programming languages/platforms are: Javascript, Typescript, Node.js, Azure, PHP and Kotlin.

You can follow me in the next sites/platforms where I constantly publish new content 😊
